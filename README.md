# Data science job project
When I try to find a job as a data scientis, I feel that it should be made clear which skills and tools are the most important as an entry level data scientist. So I grab some data from Indeed and visulize it so that I can have a good view of the hottest skillsets <br>

Stage 1: Scrapping and cleaning the html file of Indeed website concerning data science job. (Finished) <br>
Stage 2: Creating a dynamic map to visualize distribution of job skills requirement. (Ongoing) <br>
More information and functions will be added later

A simple app has been constructed. Will add more data and make the app better <br>
